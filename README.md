> **NOTICE**  
> This repository will continue to evolve based on feedback gathered during my bachelor‚Äôs thesis interviews.  
> Planned upgrades include improved narration, UX refinements for children (ages 5‚Äì8), and more control of the story options. See **Roadmap** below.

A modular, end-to-end **AI storytelling application** that generates short children‚Äôs stories, narrates them with TTS, and adds small music clips. Built as a research-driven demo to explore the usage of AI for creating and narrating children's stories.

## Highlights (Portfolio Summary)

- ‚ú® **Metadata-driven prompts:** users choose a **setting**, up to 3 **characters**, and a **theme**
- üß† **LLM story generation:** Llama 3.1 with a **three-act structure**
- ‚úÖ **Quality gate:** readability & word-count checks (TextStat), basic safety filtering
- üîä **Narration:** MeloTTS voice generation
- üéµ **Music:** MusicGen-Small music transition clips
- üß™ **Modular by design:** each stage can be replaced independently
- üñ•Ô∏è **Gradio UI:** simple interface to run the whole pipeline

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1) clone & enter
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-storyteller.git
cd ai-storyteller

# 2) create & activate venv
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac
# source .venv/bin/activate

# 3) install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4) fetch local model with Ollama
ollama pull llama3.1

# 5) run the app
python app/app.py
```

Open the URL printed in the terminal (default `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) and:
1) choose setting/characters/themes, 2) click **Create your custom story!**, 3) listen & export.

## Roadmap (Next Iterations Informed by Interviews)

- [ ] **Deployment**: fully dockerize the entire application 
- [ ] **Audio**: improve TTS model and final speech
- [ ] **UX**: clearer controls, dashboard for children or adults
- [ ] **Music**: option to choose if user wants music, look into continous background track
